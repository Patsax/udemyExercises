/* 
    The index.html file contains 25 <div> elements, each with the class of square. Please create a simple checkerboard pattern by making the even squares black and the odd squares red.

    Please note: the solution needs to select both the even and odd squares, changing the background color of the entire board will work visually, but will not pass the exercise parameters.
